A simple, responsive web application to track your daily expenses.  
Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**, this app allows you to record, view, and manage your spending while keeping a running total for different categories.

## 🚀 Features
- **Add Expenses** — Enter amount, date, and category.
- **Delete Expenses** — Remove unwanted records easily.
- **Category Totals** — Automatic calculation of totals for Food, Transport, Entertainment, and Essentials.
- **Persistent Data** — All expenses are saved in `localStorage` and remain after page refresh.
- **Responsive Design** — Works on desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **HTML5** — For the structure and layout.
- **CSS3** — For styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — For dynamic interactions and logic.
- **localStorage** — For storing expense data on the client side.
  some AI tools also have been used only for styling to make it look more visually appealing as my main focus was javascript in order to learn react from now on.
